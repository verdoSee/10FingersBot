Make sure to install selenium, you can do that by typing ```py -m pip install selenium``` in the terminal.
A very simple bot for https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english, if you ALREADY have an account there you can login by typing "y" when asked or if you don't you can skip by typing "n", eveything else is automated.
Sadly you can't place #1st because of the anticheat but it's cool to show off.
Updates coming soon with more option to choose like set WPM, or the language you would like the bot to type.
