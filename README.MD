A very simple bot for https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english, if you ALREADY have an account there you can login by typing "y" when asked or if you don't you can 
skip by typing "n", eveything else is automated.

In case you get a notification for taking an Anticheat test you can use my other bot https://github.com/verdoSee/AnticheatBypassFor10fingers to pass the test.

Updates coming soon with more option to choose like set WPM, or the language you would like the bot to type.

This is for entertainment purposes only and im not responsible for any actions taken to your account or you.
